# About Me

I’m Manohar Srikanth — a systems architect, creative technologist, and imaging nerd at heart. Over the past 20+ years, I’ve worked across deep tech, AI, and camera systems, building platforms that live at the intersection of perception, computation, and design.

I've led vision-centric engineering at Apple, Meta, and Aurora, helped launch Apple Vision Pro, and co-founded ventures exploring AI-powered imaging. At MIT, I built a drone-based lighting system for photography that won a Best Paper Award and global recognition. I'm also a published photographer with exhibitions and a passion for teaching.

My career has been about solving hard problems, shaping new platforms, and staying committed to thoughtful execution. I thrive at the edge of technology and creativity.
